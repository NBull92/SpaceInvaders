# SpaceInvaders

As a programmer in the gaming industry, it’s always good to keep making games in your free time, to understand their architecture. It’s something that comes up in programming tests rather often, even if it’s for a role that is not game programming related. Therefore, I made this SpaceInvaders as a way to keep it fresh in my mind, but to also showcase what I can do. 

I’ve tried to keep it as simple as possible, therefore I have used a WPF Canvas, with Polygons rendered on it, to represent the Player, Aliens, Bullets and Bunkers.
